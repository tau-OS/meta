# tauOS Triage

## tauOS IS NOT OUT YET. This repository is mostly for future use. Please join the Discord.

If you're unsure where an issue should go, but are sure it belongs to tauOS, you can report it here.

This repository is also where unassigned Linear issues go, bi-directional sync is enabled, so you can comment and we can see it in our Linear workspace.

For more about Fyra's workflow, well, I'd normally say click here, but there's no link, might write something up about that :3
